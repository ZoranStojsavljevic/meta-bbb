## usbutils

This is a collection of USB tools for use on Linux and BSD
systems to query what type of USB devices are connected to
the system. This is to be run on a USB host (i.e. a machine
you plug USB devices into), not on a USB device (i.e. a device
you plug into a USB host.)

Here, upon this description from:

https://github.com/gregkh/usbutils

The ATTEMPT of usbutils YOCTO recipe is introduced.

The main reason for this is to have a executable called: lsusb,
very known tool!

It is drawn from this description, shown here.

### Building and installing

Note, usbutils depends on libusb and libudev, be sure that
libraries are properly installed first.

To work with the "raw" repo, after cloning it just do:

./autogen.sh

which will build everything and place the binaries into the
build/ subdirectory.

usbutils uses meson to build, so if you wish to just build
by hand you can do:

	meson setup build
	cd build/
	meson compile
